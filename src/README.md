FabMo-Dashboard
---------------
The FabMo dashboard is a desktop application for communicating with the FabMo CNC environment.  It allows you to connect to your FabMo capable tool, execute G-Code and OpenSBP files, and run FabMo apps, which are special purpose CNC softwares designed for performing fabrication tasks.

Getting the FabMo Dashboard
---------------------------
There currently aren't any "official" binary builds of the FabMo dashboard, but the dashboard is easy to run from source, as described below.

Running from Source
-------------------
To run the dashboard, you need node.js and the FabMo-Dashboard source.  From the `src` directory, you can install the dependencies with:

Once the dependencies are successfully installed, run the dashboard (from the `src` directory) with 

```
